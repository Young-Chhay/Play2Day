Project Overview
---------------------
Whether it's to keep a competitve edge, stay in shape, or connect with friends, many people love playing sports recreationally, even if they can't play professionally. The problem is there are not many options focused on helping people organize pickup games in an easy way. Play2Day aims to fill this need by creating a space where users can connect with friends and members of their community by easily organizing pickup sports game. Users can create an account and start creating games that others can join in minutes. Users also have the ability to to join games any users create, and see a list of the games they've created as well. Get out there and Play2Day!
